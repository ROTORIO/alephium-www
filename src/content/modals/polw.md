title: Proof of Less Work

In the long term, Alephium’s PoLW algorithm reduces the energy consumption of PoW.

Adaptive rewards based on hashrate and timestamp.

Internal mining cost through burning will be enabled when the hashrate and energy consumption is significantly high.

The exact way in which the PoLW algorithm works depends on the parameters set. Currently, the parameter is set so that ⅞ of block rewards will be required to mine a new block when the energy consumption is high.

Given the same amount of block rewards and hashrate conditions, Alephium will only use ⅛ of the energy compared to Bitcoin. However, the equilibrium between the miners and the protocol changes dynamically. Although the equilibrium cannot be determined in advance, in general, Alephium uses less than or equal to ⅛ of the energy as the block reward decreases if the hashrate keeps rising.

The energy consumption of Bitcoin is approximately linear to the price growth, Alephium is sublinear which allows it to remain under 0.1%.
