title: Proof of Less Work
---

Alephium's innovative Proof of Less Work (PoLW) consensus mechanism reduces the energy consumption by over 87% compared to Nakamotoâ€™s original Proof Of Work, under the same network conditions. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the difficulty after each new block and triggers a change in the mining schema when the network surpasses 1 Exahash/s of hashrate.

Once the network exceeds this threshold, miners are required to shift part of the external cost to the internal network cost by burning some coins (and consuming proportionally less energy). In this case, mining costs are both external (energy, equipment) and internal (burning coins inside the network).

Since burning coins has a cost but does not requires energy, the energy consumption is reduced without sacrificing security: in PoLW, the cost of mining a new block is the same as in PoW, but composed differently.
