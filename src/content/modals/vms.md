title: Novel VM design
---

Alephium’s novel virtual machine is designed to resolve many of the critical issues of the current dApps platforms.

Alephium’s VM is less IO intensive ensuring unmatched performance.

Flash loan is not available by design and the VM eliminates many attack vectors of EVM, including unlimited authorization, double dip issue, reentrancy attack, etc.

Finally, its fine-grained stateful UTXO execution model reduces risk-free arbitrage.
