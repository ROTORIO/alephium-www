title: Smart contract design
---

Alephium's stateful UTXO model allows for grouping multiple participants and calls in a single smart contract transaction: this is powerful, as it allows users to interact with each other atomically through trustless P2P smart contracts. This can truly be considered as a whole new programming paradigm.

Alephium also supports smart contracts in intragroup shards.

On Alephium, tokens are first-class citizens and UTXO-based. As a result, they are effectively owned and under the custody of the users and not of the smart contracts.

In addition, it offers the same expressiveness as the account model. Powerful and secure DApps can easily be built on Alephium.
