title: Smart contract design
---

Alephium proposes a stateful UTXO model which offers both layer-1 scalability and the same level of programmability as the account model. In Alephium, multiple participants and calls can be grouped in a single smart contract transaction, which means that users can interact with each other atomically through trustless P2P smart contracts. This can truly be considered as a whole new programming paradigm for decentralized applications.

On Alephium, tokens are first-class citizens and UTXO-based. As a result, they are effectively owned and under the custody of the users and not of the smart contracts. Last but not least, smart contracts are supported in intragroup shard.

Powerful and secure dApps can easily be built on Alephium.
