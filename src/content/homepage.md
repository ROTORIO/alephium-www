    title: 'Novel VM design'
    description: >-
      Most of the modern blockchain protocols have a built-in virtual machine for general computing to implement useful and complicated decentralized applications. In Alephium, we shift from a code-centric approach to a data-centric approach and enable access and parse information from data payload of UTXOs. In this way, our script system will be as powerful as a general virtual machine.
    cardText: >-
      VMs can be a big bottleneck when it comes to Blockchain performances. Not on Alephium.
