    title: A new paradigm
    subtitle: "Alephium is the first live layer 1 sharded blockchain scaling 
    and improving on Bitcoin core technologies, Proof of Work and UTXO. It delivers 
    a highly performant, secure DeFi & dApps platform with enhanced energy efficiency."

    title: Accessibility & Usability
    subtitle: From its technical design to its interfaces, 
      Alephium has been created to address the challenges of accessibility, 
      scalability, and security encountered by decentralized applications today.

  subtitle: What makes Alephium different?
  blockFlowSection:
    title: "Scalable & Sharded"
    description: Alephium is built on a novel and complete sharding algorithm called
      BlockFlow. It improves on the UTXO model of BTC to make it scalable, and
      uses DAG data structure to reach consensus between different shards. This
      will allow up to 10’000 Transactions Per Second (currently more than
      400 TPS vs Bitcoins 7 TPS).
  smartContractSection:
    title: Programmable & Secure
    description: Alephium introduces the stateful UTXO model offering layer-1
      scalability and the same level of programmability as the account model
      used on ETH, whilst being more secure.
  polwSection:
    title: Efficiency in Energy Consumption
    description: Alephium employs "Proof of Less Work", which combines physical work
      and coin economics to dynamically adjust the work required to mine new
      blocks. Given the same network conditions, Alephium uses ~90% less energy
      compared to Bitcoin.
  vmsSection:
    title: Its own Virtual Machine & Programming Language.
    description: The Alphred Virtual Machine solves many of the critical issues of the
      current dApps platforms with huge improvements on security, development
      experience and introduces new paradigms such as trustless P2P smart
      contracts transactions. Alephium’s programming language, Ralph, has a
      syntax inspired by the Rust programming language. It allows for building
      efficient and secure smart contracts easily. It's specifically designed to
      facilitate the creation of DeFi dApps!
