  blockFlowSection:
    title: "Scaling through sharding"
    description: Alephium is built on a novel and complete sharding algorithm called
      BlockFlow. It improves on the UTXO model of BTC to make it scalable, and
      uses DAG data structure to reach consensus between different shards. This
      will allow up to 10â€™000 Transactions Per Second (currently more than
      400 TPS vs Bitcoins 7 TPS).
    cardText: BlockFlow combines DAG and sharding to enable an efficient, secure and
      verifiable consensus algorithm.

  polwSection:
    title: Sensible energy consumption
    description: Alephium employs "Proof of Less Work", which combines physical work
      and coin economics to dynamically adjust the work required to mine new
      blocks. Given the same network conditions, Alephium uses ~90% less energy
      compared to Bitcoin.
    cardText: Blockchain's success ultimately depends on its sustainability.

  smartContractSection:
    title: The Ralph dApp programming language
    description:  Ralph is inspired by the Rust programming language, so we
      decided to borrow the R too. It allows for building efficient and secure smart
      contracts easier than when using Solidity for example. It's specifically designed
      to facilitate the creation of Decentralized Finance applications!

  vmsSection:
    title: The Alphred Virtual Machine (AVM)
    description: It resolves many of the critical issues of the current dApps platforms with
      huge improvements on security, development experience and introductions of
      new paradigms such as trustless P2P smart contracts transactions.
    cardText: VMs can be a big bottleneck when it comes to Blockchain performances.
