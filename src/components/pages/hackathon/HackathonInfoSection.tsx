      <H3 divider>What can I build?</H3>
      <Paragraph>
        Participants can engage in one of two primary participation methods: embarking on the main quests or tackling
        side quests called bounties.
      </Paragraph>
      <h4>The main quests</h4>
      <Paragraph>
        Participants must form teams of 2 to 5 people and complete projects in the following categories:
      </Paragraph>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>ü™Ñ dApps Development:</b> challenge your skills in decentralized application development.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>üõ†Ô∏è Tooling:</b> Innovate with new tools to enhance blockchain functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>üîÄ Interoperability:</b> Explore the connection of Alephium with other blockchain systems.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <Paragraph>
        <i>
          Can I join with an existing project? Those who wish to start with a pre-existing project can do so, but only
          the progress made during the hackathon will be considered for evaluation and judging. Clear objectives will
          need to be set at the beginning of the hackathon to facilitate this assessment.
        </i>
      </Paragraph>
      <h4>Bounties</h4>
      <Paragraph>
        Everyone can participate as a team or hack solo (but bounties are not eligible for the main prizes). These are
        specific/smaller tasks or challenges that participants can complete for rewards. The list of bounties will be
        announced closer to the hackathon kickoff.

        Discord once we open the general chat on January 31st (date at which we‚Äôll also give a special role to accepted

      <Paragraph>Remember, you can only participate as a solo hacker in the bounties!</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        For the duration of the hackathon, the main communication Hub will be the hackathon‚Äôs general channel. You‚Äôll
        find resources, updates, and support there. You‚Äôll be able to use the channel to find teammates, mentorship from
        core-contributors or just chat!
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Additionally, each team will have access to a dedicated Discord sub-channel in a dedicated forum channel for
        discussion, progress reporting, and collaboration.
